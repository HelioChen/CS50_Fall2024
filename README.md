# CS50: This is CS50x

## Descriptions

- Offered by: Harvard
- Prerequisites: None
- Programming Languages: C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Difficulty: üåüüåü
- Class Hour: 20 hours

This course has been voted the most popular public course by Harvard students for many years. Professor Malan is very passionate in class. I still remember the scene where he tears up the Yellow pages to explain the dichotomy method. Since this is a university-wide public course, the contents are pretty friendly to beginners and even if you already have some programming experience, all the programming assignments are quite exciting and worth a try.

## Welcome

This is CS50, Harvard University‚Äôs introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. (Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before.) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today‚Äôs newer languages, via which you‚Äôll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you‚Äôll understand all the more because of C. Toward term‚Äôs end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project.
